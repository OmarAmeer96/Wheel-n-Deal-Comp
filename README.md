## Project Description

1. **Ever thought your daily commute could be more than just a boring trip from A to B?** We did! It hit us – all those cars and backpacks with unused space, just going back and forth. What if we could use that space to help others and even make some extra cash along the way? That's how Wheel N’ Deal was born! We're creating a platform that connects people who need packages delivered with others who are already heading in the right direction. It's a win-win for everyone! Senders get their packages delivered conveniently and affordably, commuters earn some extra money and make their journeys more meaningful, and the environment benefits from fewer delivery vehicles on the road.
   But here's the thing:
   Traditionally, if you need to send a package, you head to a shipping company and wait for them to deliver it. This creates two major problems:

   - **Traffic Congestion:** Delivery companies often use dedicated vehicles that add to traffic congestion, especially in urban areas.
   - **Wasted Time:** You might have to wait for the shipping company to collect enough packages before they start delivering, which can be frustrating if your package needs to get there quickly.

     Wheel N’ Deal solves these problems!
     By utilizing the existing travel routines of commuters, we eliminate the need for additional delivery vehicles, reducing traffic congestion. Additionally, our platform allows for immediate delivery matches, saving you time and ensuring your package gets where it needs to be, fast.
     It's a win-win-win! Senders save time and money, commuters earn extra income and make a difference, and the environment benefits from reduced emissions and congestion.
     Join Wheel N’ Deal and turn your daily commute into a delivery powerhouse!

2. **Here's how it works:**

   - **Senders:** Post your delivery request on the platform, tell us what you need delivered, where it needs to go, and when you need it there.
   - **Commuters:** Sign up as a commuter and let us know your regular travel routes and how much space you have available.
   - **Matching Algorithm:** Our platform uses a smart matching algorithm to connect senders with suitable commuters based on factors like travel routes, package size, and delivery timeframes.
   - **Delivery and Tracking:** Once a match is made, the sender and commuter can chat and arrange the delivery details. You can track your package in real-time on the platform, so you always know where it is.
   - **Payment and Rewards:** Senders pay a fee for the delivery service, which is shared between the platform and the commuter. Commuters can accumulate earnings and redeem them through various methods.

3. **Pretty cool, right?** With Wheel N’ Deal, we're building a community of collaborators, turning everyday commutes into opportunities to help each other and make a positive impact. Join us and turn your daily journey into a win-win for you, your community, and the planet! Let's make our commutes count!
